<h2>Why did I choose this game  ?</h2>

I wanted to created a basic game with more features than the original

<h2></h2>

<h2>How to play</h2>

- Choose your dino between 4 cute little one.
- Each 1000 points, you can one life. You start with an initial count of 3 (and you can go above)
- Dodge ennemies and go as far as you can.
- The game speed does scale on you current score, so be careful. The further it is the harder it is.

<h2>Next</h2>

- Bonuses to catch
- Sounds FX
